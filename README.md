# Overview

A set of examples on how Monte Carlo simulation can be applied to solve various problems. Here, we use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of pi and investigate how many coin flips it takes to achieve a given number of consecutive heads or tails.

## Scripts

**MCPi** *(.R)* - R code used to estimate the value of pi via Monte Carlo simulation.

**CoinFlip** *(.R)* - R code used to estimate, via Monte Carlo simulation, the number of flips necessary to achieve a given number of consecutive heads or tails.

## Figures
