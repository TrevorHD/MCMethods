# Overview

A set of examples on how Monte Carlo simulation can be applied to solve various problems. Here, we use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the value of pi and investigate how many coin flips it takes to achieve a given number of consecutive heads or tails.

**MCPi** *(.R)* - R code used to estimate the value of pi via Monte Carlo simulation.

**CoinFlip** *(.R)* - R code used to estimate, via Monte Carlo simulation, the number of flips necessary to achieve a given number of consecutive heads or tails.

## Figures

**MCPiPlots** *(.jpeg)* - A graph that shows values and convergence for the estimate of pi.

# Featured Images

The first image shows the results on Monte Carlo simulation to estimate pi; as the number of simulation replicates increases, the estimated value of pi converges on the true value of approximately 3.14. The second image shows the results on Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the number of coin flips needed for a consecutive number of heads or tails; for a given number, estimated results converge on their true values as the number of replications is increased.
